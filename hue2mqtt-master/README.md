Overview
--------
Gateway between a Philips Hue bridge and MQTT, using the official Philips
Java API library.

It is intended as a building block in heterogenous smart home environments where 
an MQTT message broker is used as the centralized message bus.
See https://github.com/mqtt-smarthome for a rationale and architectural overview.


Topic structure
===============
hue2mqtt follows the mqtt-smarthome topic structure with a top-level prefix and a function like
_status_ and _set_. Lamp, group and scene names are read from the Hue bridge.

Status reports are sent to the topic

    hue/status/lights/<lampname>
    
The payload is a JSON encoded object with the following fields:

* val - either 0 if the lamp is off, or the current brightness (1..254)
* hue_state - A JSON object which has the complete lamp state as returned from the Hue API:
   * on: boolean, whether the lamp is on
   * bri: current brightness 1..254
   * hue: hue from 0..65535
   * sat: saturation from 0..254
   * xy: an array of floats containing the coordinates (0..1) in CIE colorspace
   * ct: Mired color temperature (153..500)
   * alert: alert effect, textual
   * effect: color effect, textual
   * colormode: current color mode, textual (ct, hs, or xy)
   * reachable: boolean, whether the light is reachable

Setting state is possible in one of three ways:    

Method 1: Publishing a simple integer value to
    
    hue/set/lights/<lampname>
    
will for value=0 turn off the lamp and for values > 0 turn the lamp on and set the
brightness to the given value.

Method 2: Publishing a JSON encoded object to

    hue/set/lights/<lampname>

will set multiple parameters of the given lamp. The field names are the same as
the ones used in the hue_state state object. Additionally, a field
"transitiontime" can be specified which defines the transitiontime to the new
state in multiple of 100ms.

Method 3: Publishing a simple value to

	hue/set/lights/<lampname>/<datapoint>
	
will distinctly set a single datapoint (equal to the field names in the composite
JSON state object) to the simple value.

The fields "bri", "hue", "sat", "x", "y" and "ct" have variants with a "_inc" suffix
which accept a relative value. For example, setting "bri_inc" to "5" will increase
the brightness by 5, setting "bri_inc" to "-5" will decrease the brightness by 5.
The values will clip properly within their allowed range.

The same is possible with groups:

	hue/set/groups/<groupname>

The special group name 0 is also recognized and refers to the default group which contains
all lights connected to a bridge.
